# React frontend coding challenge

React frontend coding challenge.

## Setup

Make sure you have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** installed (latest LTS) and run:

```shell
npm install
```

## Usage

To start this project run:

```shell
npm start
```

Since this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), there are also [other scripts you can run](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts).

## Deployment

This project/repository is connected [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for automatic deployments/continuous delivery, and it's available to test at [https://coding-challenge-react-nriz8ccxnd.pages.dev](https://coding-challenge-react-nriz8ccxnd.pages.dev).

## Next steps

In a real scenario, with more time at hand, the following items should be considered:

- Loading improvements with [React Router deferred data and Suspense](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/guides/deferred). Optionally take advantage of [MUI Skeleton  component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-skeleton/) too for a better loading UX.

- Test battery using with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/app), namely:

  - End-to-end testing of the Tasks page/route, including adding a task, removing a task, reloading the page with tasks being persisted, and trying to add a task with an empty name and observing an error/unsucessful form submit, etc.

  - Testing of the proper pagination of the Users list page/route, etc.
